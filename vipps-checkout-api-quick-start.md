## Postman

### Prerequisites

Review
[Vipps quick start guides](https://github.com/vippsas/vipps-developers/blob/master/vipps-quick-start-guides.md) for information about getting your test environment set up.

### Step 1: Get the Vipps Postman collection and environment

Save the following files to your computer:

* [Vipps Checkout API Postman collection](tools/vipps-checkout-api-postman-collection.json)
* [Vipps API Global Postman environment](https://github.com/vippsas/vipps-developers/blob/master/tools/vipps-api-global-postman-environment.json)

### Step 2: Import the Vipps Postman files

1. In Postman, click *Import* in the upper-left corner.
1. In the dialog that opens, with *File* selected, click *Upload Files*.
1. Select the two files you have just downloaded and click *Import*.

### Step 3: Set up Postman environment

1. Click the down arrow, next to the "eye" icon in the top-right corner, and select the environment you have imported.
1. Click the "eye" icon and, in the dropdown window, click `Edit` in the top-right corner.
1. Fill in the `Current Value` for the following fields to get started. For the first keys, go to *Vipps Portal > Utvikler -> Test Keys.*
   * `client_id` - Merchant key is required for getting the access token.
   * `client_secret` - Merchant key is required for getting the access token.
   * `Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key` - Merchant subscription key.
   * `merchantSerialNumber` - Merchant id.
   * `internationalMobileNumber` - The mobile number for the test app profile you have received or registered, including country code.

You can update any of the other environment variables. Be aware of this:

* Any currency amount must be an Integer value minimum 100 in Ã¸re.
* Most URLs must be `https`.

## Make API calls

### Create a checkout session

1. Send request `Create a Checkout Session`. This starts a simple session by using
   [`POST:/v2/session`](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-developer-docs/api/checkout#tag/Session/paths/~1v2~1session/post).

   The `reference` and `sessionId` variables are automatically set in the environment
   of this Postman example and can be used for subsequent calls relating to this session.

## Retrieve the session information

1. Send request `Get session info`. This retrieves the session information by using
   [`GET:/v2/session/{sessionId}`](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-developer-docs/api/checkout#tag/Session/paths/~1v2~1session~1%7BsessionId%7D/get).
   The `sessionId` variable was previously set in the environment.

   You will see the details appear in the lower pane.

## Cancel the current checkout session

1. Send request `Cancel current session` to cancel the current Checkout session, if payment is not initiated.

   The `sessionId` variable, previously set in the environment, is sent in the body of
   [`GET:/v2/session/cancel`](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-developer-docs/api/checkout#tag/Session/paths/~1v2~1session~1cancel/post).
