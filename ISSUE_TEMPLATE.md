# Issue Template

BEFORE YOU SUBMIT AN ISSUE

Almost all requests we get are already covered in the technical documentation.
Please check the Knowledge base, or use the search functionality
at https://developer.vippsmobilepay.com.

If you cannot find the answer please send an email to developer@vippsmobilepay.com with all relevant information:

1. Please: Always include a detailed description of the problem with a step-by-step description of what you do and what happens.
2. A concise, self-explanatory Subject line, such as "POST:/something gives HTTP 400 response".
3. Company details: Organization number (find yours at Brønnøysundregistrene)
4. Merchant Serial Number (MSN, see Getting started)
5. Which Vipps MobilePay product or API this is about.
6. Environment: Is it a problem in the Test (MT) or the Production environment?
7. Include orderId, and preferably also transactionId and contextId, to make it possible to search in logs.
8. Date: On which date did the problem occur?
9. For API issues: We need a complete request and response. Plain HTTP from Postman ensures the quickest response.
No source code, please. Important: Remove everything except the last four characters from client_secret and Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key.
10. Please provide screenshots, if possible.
11. Please provide your contact information (if not in your email signature): Name and phone number
12. Please include any other information that may be relevant or possibly helpful.

You are welcome to use Github issues for other inquires such as general improvements, suggestions, and comments.
But it might take some time for us to get around to answer. 🚀
