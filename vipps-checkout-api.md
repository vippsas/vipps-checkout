# Checkout Features

Explains the high level features of Vipps Checkout.

## Vipps Checkout API

Vipps Checkout works around the concept of a _session_, which has a time to live of one hour. The API exposes endpoints for the merchant to interract with a session. These include:

- session initiation
- session status
- session cancellation

## Vipps Checkout frontend

Once a session is created, it is to be opened inside an iFrame embedded on the merchant website. The iFrame loads a web application that fetches all neccessary information about the session from Vipps.

### SDK

Vipps provides an SDK to make opening the session on the merchant easy. It is highly recommended to use this.

## Shipping

In most situations a merchant wants to send goods to a customer using a shipping provider. Vipps Checkout supports two different types of shipping configurations:

### Static shipping

The merchant defines a set of static shipping options that _are not_ dependant on the address of the customer. This means that the merchant has to find a reasonable price for each shipping option, taking into account that the final cost of that shipment might be either more or less than the requested amount.

### Dynamic shipping

The merchant defines a _dynamic options callback URL_, which is called by Vipps Checkout every time a customer updates their address. The callback endpoint receives the updated address, and the merchant decides on a set of shipping options to display to the user.

## Vipps Checkout Elements

With Vipps Checkout Elements, you can adjust the fields and values present in the Checkout. For example, you might have a purchasing flow where you do not require an address because you are not sending physical goods, or you do not need the customer to identify themself because they are already logged into your system.

The data collected can be adjusted according to your needs with the fields `addressFields` and `contactFields` in the session initiation request.

These fields are by default set to `true` and, if not specified, will return the full address and contact details in the Checkout session.

### AddressFields false example

If you do not need the address from a user you can disable it, resulting in the following personal details form.

![Address_field_false_form](resources/addressfields_false_form.png)

And the following payment form

![Address_field_false_form](resources/addressfields_false_form_2.png)

### Addressfields and ContactFields false example

If you do not need the contact details for a customer you can disable it, resulting in the following session

![payment_only](resources/addressfields_false_contactfields_false.png)

### Combination with shipping

These options may be combined with shipping if it fits your scenario. For example resulting in the following session:

![fields_false_with_shipping](resources/fields_false_with_shipping.png)

## Remembering of customer data

Vipps Checkout supports easy fetching of user info with the built-in Vipps Login integration. With a functionality called "Remember Me", the user is can opt in to having this information being persisted across different Vipps Checkout sessions on the same machine.

# System integration guidelines

Be sure to always use the most updated version of the API when integrating.

## Flow diagram

The standard flow for a Vipps Checkout consists of

1. Initiating a session
2. Displaying the session to the user
3. Handling the result of the session

```mermaid

  else If desktop device
    LandingPage->>Merchant: Redirect to merchant defined return URL
  end

  API-->>Merchant: Receive polling result on session
  API->>Merchant: Receive callback/webhook result on session
```

## Step 1: Initiating a session

The merchant backend calls the [session initiation endpoint](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-checkout-api/#/Session/post_v2_session)

```
POST: https://api.vipps.no/checkout/v2/session
```

with headers

| Header                        | Description                                                                           | Example value       |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| `Merchant-Serial-Number`      | Vipps assigned unique number for a merchant. Found in [Vipps portal](portal.vipps.no) |                     |
| `Client_Id`                   | Client Id. Found in [Vipps portal](portal.vipps.no)                                   |
| `Client_Secret`               | Client Secret. Found in [Vipps portal](portal.vipps.no)                               |
| `Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key`   | Subscription key. Found in [Vipps portal](portal.vipps.no)                            |
| `Vipps-System-Name`           | The name of the ecommerce solution                                                    | `woocommerce`       |
| `Vipps-System-Version`        | The version number of the ecommerce solution                                          | `5.4`               |
| `Vipps-System-Plugin-Name`    | The name of the ecommerce plugin                                                      | `vipps-woocommerce` |
| `Vipps-System-Plugin-Version` | The version number of the ecommerce plugin                                            | `1.4.1`             |

The last four headers (starting with `Vipps-System-`) are meant to identify your system (and plugin). Please use self-explanatory, human readable and reasonably short values.

All fields of the request body are described in our [Swagger](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-checkout-api/#/Session/post_v2_session). The dynamic logistics callback is found by clicking the "Callback" tab in the Swagger.

> **Note**:
> When using dynamic shipping we recommend that you define `logistics.fixedOptions` as a backup. If the callback does not resolve successfully within 8 seconds, returns `null` or an empty list the system will fall back to static options. If no fallback options are provided, the user will be presented with an error and will not be able to continue with the checkout.

The response object consists of a `token` and a `checkoutFrontendUrl`, which are used in the next step

### Configuration for use inside a native mobile application

Vipps Checkout can be used in an iOS or Android app to pay for goods and services. The Vipps Checkout frontend may then be opened directly inside a Webview, instead of as an iFrame inside a merchant website.

In this situation the merchant may wish to have a `returnUrl` to direct the user back to an application using a custom URL scheme (e.g. `myapp://`) instead of https. The frontend application will automatically try to detect if the user is on a mobile device, if so doing an "app switch" into the Vipps application, and then back to your application upon completion. Because of variations in devices and browser implementations there are certain edge cases where the device type is wrongly detected. Initiate the session with `userFlow` set to `NATIVE_REDIRECT` to ensure that the app switching is done consitently after payment.

## Step 2: Displaying the session

Load the SDK in the `<head>` section of the merchant website.

```html
<head>
  <script src="https://checkout.vipps.no/vippsCheckoutSDK.js"></script>
</head>
```

The SDK exposes a global function called `VippsCheckout`. Initialize this with the following parameters

| Parameter             | Description                                                                                                       | Optional |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| `checkoutFrontendUrl` | Specifies where to load the iFrame content from. Comes from session creation response                             | No       |
| `iFrameContainerId`   | The id of the html element to contain the Checkout iFrame                                                         | No       |
| `token`               | Token identifying the session                                                                                     | Yes      |
| `language`            | Can be set to 'no' Norwegian, or 'en' English. This is optional and will default to 'en' English if not specified | Yes      |

Example merchant website using Vipps Checkout SDK to embed an iFrame with the session in plain html/js

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Merchant website</title>
    <script src="https://checkout.vipps.no/vippsCheckoutSDK.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <button type="button" id="checkout-button">Checkout with Vipps</button>
    <section id="vipps-checkout-frame-container">
      <!-- This is where the iFrame will be embedded -->
    </section>
    <script>
      document
        .getElementById("checkout-button")
        .addEventListener("click", function () {
          // Relay an initiate session request to Vipps Checkout API trough merchants backend
          fetch("<MERCHANT BACKEND CREATE SESSION URL>", {
            method: "POST",
          })
            .then((response) => response.json())
            .then((data) => {
              var vippsCheckout = VippsCheckout({
                checkoutFrontendUrl: data.checkoutFrontendUrl,
                iFrameContainerId: "vipps-checkout-frame-container",
                language: "no",
                token: data.token,
              });
            })
            .catch((error) => {
              // Handle at least these two types of errors here:
              // 1. Fetch to create session endpoint failed
              // 2. VippsCheckout SDK not loaded resulting in VippsCheckout not being defined
            });
        });
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

> **Note**:
> The Vipps Checkout frontend **is not** supposed to be open in its own browser window/tab. The only exception to this is when using Vipps Checkout inside a Webview in a native mobile application.

### Sticky checkout session

The SDK provides an alternative way to display the session, using a query parameter in the URL. This makes the session "sticky", meaning that the same session will open after a page refresh.

If the query parameter `token` is present, and the token attribute in the argument object to VippsCheckout **is not** defined, the SDK will load the iFrame with the token from the query parameter.

We provide a helper method that, when called, will redirect to the current page with the `token` queryParameter added to the URL. Initiatlize the `VippsCheckout` function outside of initiating a session.

> **Note**:
> Make sure to initialize `VippsCheckout` outside of any user dependant execution blocks (like event handlers) to make sure that the iFrame is loaded every time a user lands on the page.

```js
// Globally defined
var vippsCheckout = VippsCheckout({
  checkoutFrontendUrl: data.checkoutFrontendUrl,
  iFrameContainerId: 'checkout-iframe-container',
});

// Create session fetch function
.then((data) => {
  vippsCheckout.redirectToCurrentPageWithToken(data.token)
})
```

## Step 3: Handling the result of the session

After the user has completed the checkout process the merchant will be notified with transaction details through a _callback_ and _polling_

> **Note**:
> It is highly recommended to implement polling in addition to callback. Vipps **does not** guarantee delivery of the callback.

### Callback Handling

The callback will be sent to a [callback endpoint (click on the "Callbacks" tab)](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-checkout-api/#/Session/post_v2_session) implemented by the merchant

```
POST: {callbackPrefix}/checkout/{apiVersion}/order/{orderId}
```

where `callbackPrefix` and `orderId` (also referred to as `transaction.reference`) are defined when initiating a session. `callbackAuthorizationToken` provided by the merchant at session initiation will be attached as the `Authorization` header. Use this to authorize the caller.

Vipps demands that every callback is responded to with a `HTTP 202 response`. In the eventuality that any other response is sent, Vipps will retry with an exponential back off until 202 is received again. During this exponential back off, Vipps will pause any new notifications until a 202 is returned on the original callback. It is critical that the endpoint receiving the callback is robust. It should also be able to receive any additional data not specified in the minimum example so that it can be backwards compatible in accordance with our integration guidelines.

### Session polling

Vipps Checkout will expose a polling endpoint as described in our [Swagger](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-checkout-api/#/Session/get_v2_session__sessionId_). The complete URL for polling is returned from the [session creation endpoint](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-checkout-api/#/Session/post_v2_session) as `pollingUrl`.

### Transaction/Payment polling

In order to determine the status of a payment, you must poll epayment as described [here](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-epayment-api/index.html#tag/QueryPayments/operation/getPayment).

# Integration partner and plugin guidelines

Vipps Checkout supports [partner-key-based authentication](https://github.com/vippsas/vipps-ecom-api/blob/master/vipps-ecom-api.md#partner-keys).

In the initiation request, use your own credentials and send the Merchant Serial Number as described. This results in an on-behalf-of authentication if the merchant has a valid connection to your solution.

## Partner signup API guidelines

If you are using the [SignupAPI](https://github.com/vippsas/vipps-signup-api), you need to use the "Ecom access" key instead of the default access token in the API calls. This API is considered deprecated by Vipps and should be migrated away from.

# Transaction operations (Capture, Cancel, Refund, Details)

Vipps Checkout should be considered an extension of existing other Vipps commerce functionality. This means that transaction operations other than payment initiation, which is handled by Checkout (see [Checkout Checklist](https://github.com/vippsas/vipps-checkout-api/blob/main/vipps-checkout-api-checklist.md)), should be done on the ePayment API described [in their official docs](https://github.com/vippsas/vipps-epayment-api). A guideline for the integration can be found [here](https://github.com/vippsas/vipps-epayment-api/blob/main/docs/api/Getting-Started.md#getting-started-with-the-vipps-merchant-payments-api). You should use the same credentials as the ones you use with Checkout.

> **Note**:
> that the Ecom API should not be used as it lacks full support for Card transactions.

> **Note**:
> Vipps Checkout only supports "Reserve-Capture". If you are on a "Direct-Capture" setup, please seek assistance in accordance with the https://github.com/vippsas/vipps-developers/blob/master/contact.md#how-to-contact-vipps-integration guidelines.

# Vipps side Transaction information

You might want to find the Vipps `transactionId` value of a transaction. This can be used, for example, to utilize [Vipps-assisted content monitoring](https://github.com/vippsas/vipps-order-management-api/blob/main/vipps-order-management-api.md#vipps-assited-content-monitoring) or to support account procedures.

## Recommended integration (currently in pilot mode)

In order to integrate with the receipts functionality, you need to retrieve the pspreference in the "paymentAction": "AUTHORISATION" event from the [eventlog](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-epayment-api/index.html#operation/getPaymentEventLog) endpoint. This is required when utilizing receipts with Vipps Checkout or Free standing card payments
