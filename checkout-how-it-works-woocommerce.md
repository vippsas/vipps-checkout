If you don't have an agreement with Vipps MobilePay, register on the [merchant portal](https://portal.vipps.no/register/vippscheckout).

**Don't know what API keys are?** [Here you can find](https://developer.vippsmobilepay.com/docs/knowledge-base/api-keys/) more info on what they are, how they're used, and how to get them.

# Improve your shipping selection

Standard WooCommerce shipping selection is not optimal, so we have integrated with the major Norwegian shipping providers to remove friction from this important step in the sales process. This list currently includes:

* Bring/Posten
* Postnord
* Porterbuddy
* Helthjem
* Instabox
