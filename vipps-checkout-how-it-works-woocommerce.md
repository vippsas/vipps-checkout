# How Checkout works for WooCommerce

With [Vipps' official WooCommerce plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/woo-vipps/), it's easy to start accepting payments with Vipps, VISA or MasterCard through Vipps Checkout.

If you have a valid set of Vipps API keys, which means if you have a *Vipps p√• nett* or *Vipps Checkout* agreement, you can start using Vipps Checkout.

If you don't have an agreement with Vipps, [click here to order](https://portal.vipps.no/register/vippscheckout).

# Vipps for WooCommerce plugin installation

The installation process is described [here](https://github.com/vippsas/vipps-woocommerce), but can be summarised as:

1.  Install the plugin using the WordPress [built-in installer](https://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Installing_Plugins). The plugin can also be installed manually by uploading the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress.
3. Go to the WooCommerce Settings page and choose Payment Gateways (Betalinger) and enable Vipps.
4. Go the settings page for the Vipps plugin and enter your Vipps account keys. Your account keys are available in the [Vipps Developer Portal](https://portal.vipps.no).

# Checkout specific setup

Checkout replaces the default WooCommerce checkout window with a Vipps-designed window, giving you better conversion and less hassle.

Features specific to Vipps Checkout are accessed in the *Payments* settings in the Admin panel.

To turn on Checkout, simply check the box at the top of the "Vipps Checkout" screen.

- Porterbuddy
- Helthjem
- Instabox
