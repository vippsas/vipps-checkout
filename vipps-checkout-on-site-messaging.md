# Vipps on-site messaging

Vipps On-Site Messaging contains a _badges_ in different variants that can be used to let your customers know that Vipps payment is accepted.

To be able to use the badge on your site you need to add the Vipps On-Site Messaging JavaScript library.
The library should preferably be added between your page's `<head>...</head>`-tags and only once per page:

```html
<script async type="text/javascript" src="https://checkout.vipps.no/on-site-messaging/v1/vipps-osm.js"></script>
```

If you don't have access to edit your websites code directly you can also place the JavaScript library just before the chosen badge.

## Badge

The On-Site Messaging library contains an easy to integrate _badge_ with tailor made message for use in your online store.
The badge comes in five variants with different color-pallets to suite your website.

### Example

#### Attributes

All attributes are optional.

| Attribute    | Description                                                                                                                                             | Default |
|:-------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:--------|
| variant      | The color variant of the badge. Supported values: `white`, `orange`, `gray`, `light-orange`, `purple`.                                                  | `white` |
| language     | ISO 639-1 alpha-2 language code. Supported values: `en`, `no`.                                                                                     | `no`    |
| vipps-senere | Set this to `true` if your business supports the "Vipps Senere"-product.                                                                                | `false` |
| amount       | The payable amount in NOK. Amounts are specified in minor units. For Norwegian kroner (NOK) that means 1 kr = 100 øre. Example: 499 kr = 49900 øre. |         |

#### Customization

You can customize the placement and size of the _badge_ by either applying your own CSS-style with the `class` or `style` attribute.

If the badge is too small or too large to fit your content, you can override the `font-size` to scale the _badge_ as follows:

```html
<vipps-badge vipps-senere variant="purple" style="font-size: 1.5rem;"></vipps-badge>
```

Which will scale the badge to 1.5x the size of the root font-size. You may also use `px` or `em` values to scale the _badge_.

Use `text-align` to align the badge:

```html
<vipps-badge vipps-senere amount="100000" variant="purple" style="text-align: center;"></vipps-badge>
```
